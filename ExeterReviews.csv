1287025,31st May 23,"I am from the USA, so I am comparing my experience to my home UNI to my time at Exeter. My UNI in the US had a lot larger campus, and the gym/rec building was free for students because it was part of the tuition. The buildings at my home UNI were also a lot more modern, and there were more facilities. There was a building for blowing glass, 3D printing, and other things for design. The forum isn't the best. My UNI had a lot larger library, and there was a lot more space for studying. The clubs/societies at Exeter almost all require money to join, and more money each time you want to go to a club event. My UNI back home allocated money to the different clubs, so many were free. The only time you had to pay for clubs at my home UNI was if you were going on a trip. My UNI back home doesn't have a student union. I did not interact with the career services in Exeter. One thing Exeter did better than my home UNI was the internet. My home UNI had some trouble with internet.",3.4,3,3,3,5
1286468,20th May 23,"Exeter University is generally a lovely place to study at. The Exeter-based campuses are awesome, with a great balance of green/study space. The wifi has been unreliable at times, but overall I don’t have any complaints.",4,5,4,4,3

485635,3rd May 23,"Exeter University was my first choice and I don't regret my decision. The forum is my favourite area and the grounds are incredible, for a day or night time walk.

1284138,15th April 23,"Bit few study spaces, sometimes get the impression that the uni doesn’t really care about its students, nor its staff. Module choice is alright, but nothing extraordinary. If you decide to study politics/IR, be prepared for a lack of support, teaching yourself about methods and that everything happens really late. It’s a green campus, the library is a bit sad but are other options on campus once you find them. The 2 pound meal is a plus. Be prepared for the hill and high rent.",3,3,2,3,4

784001,12th April 23,"Exeter has it all. Even though it is a campus based University, the 10minuets walk into the city makes it feel like it’s both city and campus. With the beach 20mins away by train it makes a great weekend excursion whilst at uni.",5,5,5,5,5

483953,11th April 23,Studying at the University of Exeter has been the one of the best decisions I have made. I hated secondary school due to personal problems yet I always loved learning. I came to Exeter for a fresh start and to have the social life I never had in my childhood and it has been the best thing that has happened to me.

The local nature walks and wildlife all around is truly special.,4.2,4,5,4,3
1083950,11th April 23,"The library opens 24/7 and you can use theirncomputers there and also at other areas in the Forum which is an open space at the university. There is no limitis for the society you participate in. You can literally still connect to the uni wifi at certain close area out of campus. The career service not only offers workshops and an app to assist students with job application, they also allow you to book one to one appointment so that they can discuss specific issues faced by you.",4.6,5,4,5,4
1283946,11th April 23,Good overall. But should listen to wishes of the student body and cut ties with Shell. The Students Guild also needs to support student protest,3.4,4,4,3,3
783944,11th April 23,"Enjoyed my time here a lot, lovely environment and classes have been engaging. Can’t say the provision during recent strikes or indeed the year of my degree which was online due to covid was brilliant, and it was very isolating, but the past two in person years have made up for that. Some staff in the English department can be disorganised but the majority are brilliant and student focused in their work and aims and support. Library has good and useful resources. Lots of opportunity to work on campus with great pay and hours - I personally work at the Career Zone and have found it rewarding, fun, and helpful in gaining knowledge towards my future career choices.",4.6,5,4,5,5

The only issues I have had have been with timetabling consistently each term giving me classes that overlap. Considering the amount we pay I would at least like to be able to attend my classes! Though this is more an issue with the people in timetabling rather than the university itself I thought it worth mentioning.
Other than that I have had an excellent time at Exeter and really engaged with some wonderful classes and lecturers.",3.8,4,4,3,4

1166319,14th February 22,"I love studying at Exeter. The perfect mix of fun, societies and clubs with a really high level education. I study business and french and have found the lecturers are seminar leaders to be mostly very helpful and attentive. Unlike a lot of universities, as a campus university it is so easy to socialise and make friends as everyone is on campus. I only have one online lecture a week which is incredible in comparison to my friends in bigger unis like Leeds or Bristol who have barely met their course mates as their lectures are almost entirely online. It is such a sociable uni and so easy to meet lots of people, and the stereotypes of people in Exeter are mostly untrue in my opinion. There are a lot of Surrey people here tho. I initially thought that the campus being further away from city would be an issue, but it is literally a ten minute walk. Unlike most other unis, all the main first year acoms are less than a fifteen min walk from campus and the same distance from town.",4.2,5,5,3,5

And now I think I made a best choice. The campus is amazing, the faculties are like a best friends to us, they just don’t teach also they provide us all the sources.

The study spaces are great to work in, ample opportunity to be comfortable at your own desk with a view. Although, a downfall is that the internet connection requires a password which you have to go to IT to find out, otherwise you will be logging into the wifi system every 20-40 minutes which is quite annoying. The Careers Service is great in offering lots of opportunities for talks and events to attend about CV writing and cover letter, but a little more help on one to one meetings talking about applications wouldn't go un-appreciated.

There is a disgraceful lack of student support with mental health, the isolation of covid 19 and other issues I have had with my degree. The university campus security are rude and even violent towards students and very vindictive. The university nightlife is pretty terrible so if thats something you care about go elsewhere.

The staff are unsympathetic, feedback vague and contradictory. I went to my tutor to ask for more detailed feedback or examples of how I could have improved my work and he was unable to go into more detail but considering the mark I was given there must have been a lot there to improve. If you're going to spend £9,250, spend it on somewhere that actually cares about its students. Exeter only cares about it's reputation and the lecturers are definitely chosen based on their research rather than the quality of their teaching which would be fine but again for the amount of money you would be better off elsewhere.",4,4,4,4,5

447063,18th May 20,"The University of Exeter has excellent facilities. Had my course been less time-consuming, I would have taken the opportunity to do more sport and societies.
The only two things I found to be problematic were:
1. The student services team is slow, probably because they are understaffed, but also because their processes are poorly thought through. I expected a higher standard from a Russell Group university in this regard; having studied at undergraduate level with a non-Russell Group university, I was surprised when these processes were not nearly as good as my former university.
2. Student loans are released termly by Student Finance England. However, the University of Exeter seem to think it is reasonable to expect their tuition fee payments to come in per semester; so in two instalments, rather than the three they come in. As such, you have to apply to Student Services to get this changed; it just seems nonsensical.

Nightlife is getting better and better and great artists&dj s now come very regularly to Exeter!
Also each year 's freshers' week were full of interesting activities to take part in (Satursday's freshers fair is crazy packed tho).
To conclude I miss it so much I cannot but recommend that you go and have a look for yourself ! I remember walking back from campus in the evening with an incredible sky and such a picturesque scenery as well as bird's singing. You won't regret it!",5,5,5,5,5

Sports facilities need to be cheaper given the price of the fees we pay to study at university, and would certainly encourage students to take on healthier lifestyle.

Campus/Facilities:
I stayed in the St. Germans (sometimes called just Rowe house but they're not the same!) and literally could not have asked for better.

But it was nice for us at least so get in while you can. Gym is also new and super fresh, it can get quite busy but there are a lot of different cardio machines and stuff so its usually fine. actual campus is also nice and modern.
Club/societies:
there is smt for everyone, so def get involved in at least one or two, makes the year a lot of fun and you always have events to look forward to throughout the year, exeter is quite a small town after all so you need to spice your life up a bit!",4.6,5,5,5,4

The campus is lovely, very green, and with lots of facilities. Exeter city is big enough for a University town, and is in a perfect location for the Coast, Dartmoor and not too far from Bristol.
